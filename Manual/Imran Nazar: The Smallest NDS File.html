  <title>Imran Nazar: The Smallest NDS File</title>
  <meta http-equiv="description" content="Embedded development is often focused on the size of the resultant binary, especially on platforms where this factor is important. On the Nintendo GBA and DS, the homebrew toolchain is able to generate well-optimised binaries, but programs with equivalent functionality tend to have very different sizes. This article looks into why that is the case, and explores the format of a Nintendo DS binary file in an attempt to make the smallest DS binary possible.">

  <p>Have you ever wondered what exactly is inside a Nintendo DS ROM file, 
  and why the simple DS demos are so much larger than their GBA equivalents?
  Some people have, and this page documents their exploits.</p>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>It started innocently enough. I was looking for a small ROM which
  would be used to test the framebuffer display mode of DSemu, a Nintendo DS
  emulator. LiraNuna agreed to put a small C demo together, to fill the 'main'
  screen with red, demonstrating the framebuffer's use. When compiled and
  spliced up, the .nds ended up at around 7.5KB.</p>
  <p>That, LiraNuna thought, was a bit large for something that did so little
  as his demo evidently did. Stepping through with DSemu's debugger, I
  noticed a whole lot of code being run which wasn't strictly required:
  setting up cache parameters and the stack, clearing out regions of memory,
  and such like. Referred to as the crt0, this code is inserted into every
  project, to safeguard the execution environment.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, there was the standard ARM7 code also inserted into the
  .nds file, which does such things as set up the touchscreen. All this, we
  thought, was a bit over-the-top for a demo that was literally doing almost
  nothing. So, the cut-down began.</p>
  <h3>Early stages: Chopping the ARM7</h3>
  <p>First off, LiraNuna thought the functionality of the ARM7 wasn't
  particularly required for this demo. So, the thought process went, why not
  simply tell that 'sub' CPU to enter an infinite loop and not do anything?
  The reasoning was sound, and so the ARM7 source file was replaced with a
  simple assembly file, looking something like this.</p>
  <div class="sample"> 
   <h4>ARM7 cut-down: Infinite loop</h4>
   <div class="inner">main: b main</div>
  </div>
  <p>Once put together, that reduced the size of the overall .nds file
  by quite a way; down to approximately 5KB. However, I still thought that
  was a touch large. A quick peek into the .nds file showed why that was:
  the sub CPU, just like the main CPU, has a crt0 automatically inserted by
  the build process, and this made up the vast majority of the ARM7 portion
  of the .nds file.</p>
  <p>Therefore, LiraNuna took the step of subverting a part of the build process,
  by deleting the result of the ARM7 compilation, and replacing it with a
  straight binary file, encoding the infinite-loop opcode.</p>
  <div class="sample">
   <h4>ARM7 cut-down: Final binary</h4>
   <div class="inner">0000   FE FF FF EA</div>
  </div>
  <p>That left the overall binary at around 4KB. Still plenty of room for
  improvement, I thought.</p>
  <h3>The Next Step: Assembly</h3>
  <p>The main code was still in C, and compiled to Thumb binary. Stepping
  through that in DSemu's debugger, I noticed a few odd things introduced by
  the compiler, that seemed to do very little; values being left-shifted and
  then right-shifted again, to no overall effect, and similar oddities.
  So, the next logical step was to write that portion without the intervention
  of the compiler, in assembly.</p>
  <p>LiraNuna put together a first attempt at an assembly version of the
  program, as follows.</p>
  <div class="sample">
   <h4>ARM9 cut-down: First run</h4>
   <div class="inner">main:
		@ sets POWER_CR
	mov r0, #0x4000000
	orr r0, r0, #0x300
	orr r0, r0, #0x4
	mov r1, #0x3
	str r1, [r0]
 
		@ sets mode
	mov r0, #0x04000000
	mov r1, #0x00020000
	str r1, [r0]
 
		@ sets VRAM bank a
	mov r0, #0x04000000
	add r0, r0, #0x240
	mov r1, #0x80
	strb r1, [r0]
 
		@ loop
	mov r0, #0x06800000
	mov r1, #0x1F
	orr r1, r1, #0x8000
	mov r2, #0x18000
 
	filloop:
		strh r1, [r0], #0x1
		subs r2, r2, #0x1
		bne filloop
 
	lforever:
      b lforever
   </div>
  </div>
  <p>When compiled up, that definitely made a difference; the overall ROM size
  dropped to approximately 1.5KB. However, I started to have an inkling that
  we could do better. And that's when pepsiman piped up with a suggestion:
  place the code <em>inside</em> the .nds header.</p>
  <h3>Going deeper: Inside the .nds file</h3>
  <p>What did pepsiman mean by that? In order to understand that, it's important
  to know what a .nds ROM looks like, on the inside.</p>
  <table>
   <thead><tr><th>File offset</th><th>Component</th></tr></thead>
   <tbody>
    <tr><td>0000</td><td>NDS ROM header (512 bytes)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0200</td><td>ARM9 binary</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0200+ARM9</td><td>ARM7 binary</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0200+both</td><td>Optional file table</td></tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>The conventional layout dictates that the main CPU's binary be placed
  after the header, and the sub CPU's binary after that. However, that doesn't
  have to hold true all the time; the order can be swapped, blank space can be
  inserted between the binaries, or after them.</p>
  <p>That's all well and good, but <em>inside</em> the header? In order to
  understand that, it's required to look inside that top chunk of the file:
  the ROM header.</p>

  <p>The entries highlighted red indicate regions of empty space in the
  header structure. These are normally left behind during the construction
  of the format, to allow for expansion. In this case, however, it's
  possible to make use of the blank regions in the header for the purposes
  of holding code.</p>
  <p>From looking at the above output, it's simple to see that the structure
  of the .nds file as a whole is dictated by the entries in this header.
  The fact that the ARM9 binary follows the header is simply due to the setting
  of "ARM9 ROM offset" to <code>0x200</code>, which is the first byte in the
  file after the header. Similarly, the ARM7 code following the ARM9 is a
  simple effect of the "ARM7 ROM offset" being set to <code>0x600</code>, which
  corresponds to an offset in the file of 1.5KB.</p>
  <p>Simply by changing the "ROM offset" values in this header, it's possible
  to change the point from which the code for the CPUs is loaded, from the
  default location after the header to somewhere inside the header; overwrite
  the zeros in that position with ARM opcodes, and load from there. It seemed
  a good idea by pepsiman, and viable.</p>
  <p>LiraNuna's ARM9 code seemed quite short, but I thought I could go one
  better, shrinking the code down further.</p>
  <div class="sample">
   <h4>ARM9 cut-down: Second run</h4>
   <div class="inner">main:
    mov r0,#0x04000000      ; I/O space offset
    mov r1,#0x3             ; Both screens on
    mov r2,#0x00020000      ; Framebuffer mode
    mov r3,#0x80            ; VRAM bank A enabled, LCD
 
    str r1,[r0, #0x304]     ; Set POWERCNT
    str r2,[r0]             ;     DISPCNT 
    str r3,[r0, #0x240]     ;     VRAMCNT_A
 
    mov r0,#0x06800000      ; VRAM offset
    mov r1,#31              ; Writing red pixels
    mov r2,#0xC000          ; 96k of them
 
lp: strh r1,[r0],#2         ; Write a pixel
    subs r2,r2,#1           ; Move along one
    bne lp                  ; And loop back if not done

nf: b nf                    ; Sit in an infinite loop to finish
   </div>
  </div>
  <p>Once assembled, this code ended up looking like the following.</p>
  <div class="sample">
   <h4>ARM9 cut-down: Assembled binary</h4>
   <div class="inner">0000   01 03 A0 E3   03 10 A0 E3   02 28 A0 E3   80 30 A0 E3
0010   04 13 80 E5   00 20 80 E5   40 32 80 E5   1A 05 A0 E3
0020   1F 10 A0 E3   03 29 A0 E3   B2 10 C0 E0   01 20 52 E2
0030   FC FF FF 1A   FE FF FF EA</div>
  </div>
  <p>Definitely a little smaller; now the matter remained of where to put it,
  along with the ARM7 binary of one opcode (<code>EAFFFFFE</code>). The ARM7
  was simple enough: the first region of blank space, 8 bytes, was ample space
  to place this opcode. The ARM7 offset was changed, the size changed to 4,
  and that part was done.</p>
  <p>The ARM9 code was similarly simple to place in: the 160 bytes of free
  space at the end of the header seemed more than enough to stash the binary,
  and all that remained was to modify the ARM9 ROM offset and size.</p>
  <p>And that, it seemed, was that. All the code fit comfortably into the
  header, and the final .nds was just 512 bytes in size. Surely that was all
  that could be done? Not quite.</p>
  <h3>To the core: Repositioning</h3>
  <p>As it turns out, not all 512 bytes of the header are used. The 160 bytes
  on the end are in the header simply by convention; one might as well say
  that the .nds file consists of a 352-byte header, 160 bytes of padding,
  and then the two CPU binaries. Was it possible to fit the 56-byte ARM9
  binary somewhere else inside the header, and eliminate this padding?</p>
  <p>I started by changing the "header size" field at <code>0x84</code> to
  reflect the new size of the header, which would be <code>0x160</code> bytes.
  Then, I started inserting the opcodes, until I had something like this.</p>
  <div class="sample">
   <h4>ARM9 placement: Within the header</h4>
   <div class="inner">0070   01 03 A0 E3   03 10 A0 E3   02 28 A0 E3   80 30 A0 E3
0080   00 00 00 00   A0 01 00 00   04 13 80 E5   00 20 80 E5
0090   40 32 80 E5   1A 05 A0 E3   1F 10 A0 E3   03 29 A0 E3
00A0   B2 10 C0 E0   01 20 52 E2   FC FF FF 1A   50 41 53 53
00B0   FE FF FF EA   00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00</div>
  </div>
  <p>The fields in the header at 0x80, 0x84 and 0xAC can be seen, nestled
  within the ARM9 code. Now, this is quite a problem; if those values correspond
  to valid opcodes, they may be executed, and that might prove disastrous for
  the state of the program.</p>
  <p>A disassembly was called for. I loaded up the new binary in DSemu, and
  the debugger gave the following output:</p>
  <div class="sample">
   <h4>ARM9 cut-down: Code after insertion</h4>
   <div class="inner">    mov r0,#0x04000000     
    mov r1,#0x3            
    mov r2,#0x00020000     
    mov r3,#0x80

    <span class="red">andeq r0, r0, r0, lsr #3</span>
    str r1,[r0, #0x304]    
    str r2,[r0]            
    str r3,[r0, #0x240]    
    mov r0,#0x06800000     
    mov r1,#31             
    mov r2,#0xC000
lp: strh r1,[r0],#2        
    subs r2,r2,#1          
    bne lp                 
    <span class="red">cmppls r3, #0x14</span>
nf: b nf                   
   </div>
  </div>
  <p>It seems I was fortunate. The first two AND statements will never be
  executed, since they depend on the ZERO flag being set, and said flag is
  not set by the instructions above. As for the CMP, it slots into place
  after the VRAM-writing loop, which is indeed fortunate; if the CMP had
  fallen before the BNE, the loop may have executed forever, eventually
  running out of VRAM to write to.</p>
  <p>Surprisingly fortunate, I thought; I hadn't planned for such a consequence,
  and it had simply come about due to the size and structure of the code.
  Either way, I wasn't about to complain.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>So, there we have it. The smallest .nds file you're ever likely to see,
  which still does something. The ARM7 sticks itself into an infinite loop,
  and the ARM9 fills the main-core framebuffer with red before entering its
  own infinite loop. I eventually got my wish, of a small framebuffer-testing
  demo, but it was fun to get there.</p>
